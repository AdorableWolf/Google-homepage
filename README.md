Deconstructing the google homepage and rebuilding it to understand HTML/CSS layouts and order

By doing the above activity, I demonstrated a solidunderstanding of the basic layout and good web-development practices when it comes to content placement and logical ordering of the items with parent enclosing tags. Along with this I practised CSS formating skills to make the webpage look as similiar to google homepage as I possibly can.
